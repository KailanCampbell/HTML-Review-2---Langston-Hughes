      Excerpt from one of his poems, "Let America be America Again" :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
      </li>
      <li>
        I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am the red man driven from the land,
      </li>
      <li>
        I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
      </li>
      <li>
        And finding only the same old stupid plan
      </li>
      <li>
        Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
      </li>
    </ul>
